# Security Policy

Stellar Royalty Splitter handles on-chain fund distribution via a Soroban smart contract and a
Node.js backend API. We take security seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure of any
vulnerabilities.

---

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Report security issues privately by emailing:

**security@stellar-royalty-splitter.dev**

If you prefer encrypted communication, please request our PGP public key in your first email.

### What to include

- A clear description of the vulnerability and its potential impact
- Step-by-step reproduction instructions or a proof-of-concept
- The affected component (contract, backend API, signing key handling, frontend)
- Any suggested remediation if you have one

---

## Responsible Disclosure Process

1. **Submit** your report to the email address above.
2. **Acknowledgement** — We will confirm receipt within **48 hours**.
3. **Triage** — We will assess severity and scope within **5 business days**.
4. **Fix & Patch** — We will develop and test a fix. Timeline depends on severity:
   - Critical / High: patched within **7 days**
   - Medium: patched within **30 days**
   - Low / Informational: addressed in the next scheduled release
5. **Disclosure** — We coordinate a public disclosure date with you after the patch is live.
   We default to a **90-day** disclosure window from the date of your report.
6. **Credit** — With your permission, we will acknowledge your contribution in the release notes.

We ask that you:
- Give us reasonable time to fix the issue before public disclosure.
- Avoid accessing, modifying, or exfiltrating user data during research.
- Limit testing to accounts you own or have explicit permission to test.

## Scope

### In Scope

The following components are in scope for security research:

**Smart Contract (`src/lib.rs`)**
- Logic errors in royalty distribution (e.g. incorrect basis-point arithmetic, rounding exploits)
- Unauthorized invocation of privileged functions (`initialize`, `distribute`, `pause`, `admin_transfer`)
- Admin key / authorization bypass vulnerabilities
- Re-entrancy or cross-contract call vulnerabilities
- Integer overflow / underflow in share calculations
- Ability to drain contract funds without calling `distribute`

**Backend API (`backend/`)**
- Authentication or authorization bypass on API endpoints
- Exposure of `SERVER_SECRET_KEY` or `SIGNING_KEY_FILE` contents via API responses, logs, or errors
- Injection vulnerabilities (SQL, command, header injection)
- Insecure handling of the `ADMIN_ROTATE_TOKEN` bearer token
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Horizon / Soroban RPC URL parameters
- Path traversal when reading `SIGNING_KEY_FILE`

**Signing Key Handling**
- Scenarios where the server signing key could be extracted by an attacker
- Weak key-rotation logic that allows a stale key to be reused after rotation

**Deployment Configuration**
- Hardcoded secrets committed to the repository
- Insecure default environment variable values in `.env.example`

### Out of Scope

- Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies that are already publicly disclosed (report those
  upstream)
- Denial-of-service attacks against the public Stellar network itself
- Social engineering or phishing attacks targeting contributors
- Issues in Stellar / Soroban infrastructure outside this project's control
- Theoretical vulnerabilities without a realistic attack path
- Freighter wallet internals (report those to the Freighter team)

## Expected Response Times

| Stage | Target |
|---|---|
| Acknowledgement | 48 hours |
| Triage & severity assessment | 5 business days |
| Fix — Critical / High | 7 days |
| Fix — Medium | 30 days |
| Fix — Low / Informational | Next scheduled release |
| Coordinated public disclosure | Up to 90 days from initial report |

---

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

- Never commit secrets, private keys, or `.env` files — `.gitignore` covers these, but verify
  before every push.
- Use `SIGNING_KEY_FILE` (secrets-manager integration) rather than `SERVER_SECRET_KEY` in
  production environments.
- Rotate `ADMIN_ROTATE_TOKEN` after any suspected compromise.
- Keep the Stellar CLI and all dependencies up to date.
- Review the `SECURITY_AUDIT.md` in this repository for known findings and their mitigations.
