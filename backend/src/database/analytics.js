/**
 * Analytics query functions.
 * Provides aggregated insights on transactions, distributions, and collaborator performance.
 *
 * #503: All figures are computed with set-based JOIN/GROUP BY queries rather than
 * iterating transactions and issuing a per-row lookup (the old N+1 pattern). The
 * number of database round-trips is therefore constant — it does not grow with the
 * number of transactions or collaborators. Results are memoised for 60s so repeated
 * dashboard polls reuse the same aggregate instead of re-scanning the tables.
